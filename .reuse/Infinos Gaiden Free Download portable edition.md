Now that you know what Infinos Gaiden is and what it offers, you might be wondering how to play it better. Here are some tips and tricks that will help you improve your skills and score in this game.
 
- Use the bit system wisely. The bit is your main weapon and can be switched between three different modes: front, side, and back. Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on the situation. For example, front mode is good for concentrated fire, side mode is good for wide coverage, and back mode is good for protecting your rear. Experiment with each mode and find the one that suits your playstyle.
- Collect power-ups and avoid damage. Power-ups are essential for upgrading your bit and increasing your firepower. They come in three colors: red, green, and blue. Each color corresponds to a different type of laser: straight, spread, and homing. Try to collect the same color as your bit to upgrade it faster. However, be careful not to take damage, as this will lower your bit level and make you weaker.
- Learn the enemy patterns and stage layouts. Infinos Gaiden is a game that rewards memorization and practice. Each enemy has a fixed pattern of movement and attack, and each stage has a fixed layout of obstacles and hazards. By learning these patterns and layouts, you can anticipate the enemy's actions and avoid their fire. You can also find the best spots to position yourself and deal damage.
- Use the challenge mode to hone your skills. Infinos Gaiden has a challenge mode where you can play any stage you have unlocked in arcade mode with a fixed bit level and weapon type. This mode is great for practicing your skills and learning the stages without worrying about power-ups or lives. You can also compare your scores with other players on the online leaderboard.

With these tips and tricks, you will be able to master Infinos Gaiden and enjoy its retro charm. If you haven't downloaded the game yet, what are you waiting for? Grab it now and start shooting!
